# CPP-Final // Jack Reis And Adam Gibson
User gets to pick what game they want to play (Magic or Miner) or they can quit.
If they pick Miner it runs them through a tutorial on hhow the game works and tells them to buy one miner.
They can keep waiting for money, go to the shop or retire.
If they go to the they will see a menu of items to buy or they can go to back and earn more money.
If they choose to retire it displays your money and your multiplier and it prints it in a txt document.
If they later decide to play again they can pick up where they left off.

MAGIC
If they Pick Magic they will be told to pick a number between 0 and 15. You never have to tell me your number.
There is a set of four cards laid out with 8 numbers. If the number you picked is on the card you input yes, if it's not you input no.
You can update the cards in any order you'd like, and it will magically guess your number correctly. Press quit if you'd like to see the
instructions again. 


TEST MODE is the reversed mode where instead of the user inputting the yes no answers, and the computer magically guessing the number, 
the computer randomly will populate the yes/no answers with the cards. The user will then guess the number based on the yes/no answers given to them by the computer.
